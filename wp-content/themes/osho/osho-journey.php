                        <h3>1969 - 1974 Mumbai Years</h3>
                        <p>Late 1960’s: His Hindi talks become available in English translations.</p>
                        <p>1970: In July, 1970, He moves to Mumbai, where He lives until 1974.</p>
                        <p>1970: Osho – at this time called Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh – begins to initiate seekers into
                            Neo-Sannyas or discipleship, a path of commitment to self-exploration and meditation which
                            does not involve renouncing the world or anything else. Osho’s understanding of ‘Sannyas’ is
                            a radical departure from the traditional Eastern viewpoint. For Him it is not the material
                            world that needs to be renounced but our past and the conditionings and belief systems that
                            each generation imposes on the next. He continues to conduct meditation camps at Mount Abu
                            in Rajasthan but stops accepting invitations to speak throughout the country. He devotes his
                            energies entirely to the rapidly expanding group of sannyasins around Him.</p>
                        <p>
                            At this time, the first Westerners begin to arrive and to be initiated into Neo-Sannyas.
                            Among them are leading psychotherapists from the human potential movement in Europe and
                            America, seeking the next step in their own inner growth. With Osho they experience new,
                            original meditation techniques for contemporary man, synthesizing the wisdom of the East
                            with the science of the West.

                        <h3>1974 - 1981 Poona Ashram</h3>
                        <p>During these seven years He gives a 90 minutes discourse nearly every morning, alternating
                            every month between Hindi and English. His discourses offer insights into all the major
                            spiritual paths, including Yoga, Zen, Taoism, Tantra and Sufism. He also speaks on Gautam
                            Buddha, Jesus, Lao Tzu, and other mystics. These discourses have been collected into over
                            600 volumes and translated into 50 languages.</p>
                        <p>In the evenings, during these years, He answers questions on personal matters such as love,
                            jealousy, meditation. These ‘darshans’ are compiled in 64 darshan diaries of which 40 are
                            published.</p>
                        <p>The commune that arose around Osho at this time offers a wide variety of therapy groups which
                            combine Eastern meditation techniques with Western psychotherapy. Therapists from all over
                            the world are attracted and by 1980 the international community gained a reputation as ‘ the
                            world’s finest growth and therapy center.’ One hundred thousand people pass through its
                            gates each year.</p>
                        <p>1981: He develops a degenerative back condition. In March 1981, after giving daily discourses
                            for nearly 15 years, Osho begins a three-year period of self-imposed public silence. In view
                            of the possible need for emergency surgery, and on the recommendation of His personal
                            doctors, He travels to the U.S. This same year, His American disciples purchase a
                            64,000-acre ranch in Oregon and invite Him to visit. He eventually agrees to stay in the
                            U.S. and allows an application for permanent residence to be filed on His behalf.</p>

                    Nobody is going to be my successor. Each sannyasin is my representative. When I am dead, you all –
                    individually – will have to represent me to the world. There is not going to be any pope. There is
                    not going to be any shankaracharya. Each sannyasin, in his own capacity, has to represent me. This
                    has never happened – but it is going to happen! You are all my successors. When I am dead, that
                    simply means I have left this body and entered all the bodies of my people. I will be within you. I
                    will be part of you.
