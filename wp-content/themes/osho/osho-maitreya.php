                            His thousands of hours of extemporaneous talks, spoken to people from around the world over
                            a twenty-year period, are all recorded, often on video. The transcriptions of these talks
                            are published in hundreds of titles in dozens of languages. In these talks, the human mind
                            is put under the microscope as never before, analyzed to the smallest wrinkle. Mind as
                            psychology, mind as emotion, mind as mind/body; mind as moralist, mind as belief; mind as
                            religion, mind as history, mind as politics and social evolution – all examined, studied,
                            and integrated and then graciously left behind in the essential quest for transcendence.

                            In the process Osho exposes hypocrisy and humbug wherever he sees it. As the author, Tom
                            Robbins so eloquently said:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “I recognize the emerald breeze when it rattles my shutters. And Osho is like a hard, sweet
                            wind, circling the planet, blowing the beanies off of rabbis and popes, scattering the lies
                            on the desks of the bureaucrats, stampeding the jackasses in the stables of the powerful,
                            lifting the skirts of the pathologically prudish and tickling the spiritually dead back to
                            life.

                    Osho is a very beautiful word. It should be added to every language. Just the sound is beautiful in
                    the first place: Osho. It shows respect, it shows love, it shows gratitude. It is not just a dry
                    word like ‘Reverend’. It is a very loving and friendly word, almost having the sense of ‘The
                    Beloved’.
